##### cert-manager

cert-manager adds **certificates** and **certificate issuers** as resource types in Kubernetes clusters. It also helps you to **obtain, renew, and use those certificates**. 

To add it to our installation, we have to remove the package from the **excluded_packages**.
```editor:select-matching-text
file: tap-values.yml
text: "  - cert-manager.tanzu.vmware.com"
```
```editor:replace-text-selection
file: tap-values.yml
text: ""
```
As you can see in the component documentation here, it's also possible to install the package individually but we are using the profile installation as described in the last section.

##### Contour

One of the most critical needs when running workloads at scale on Kubernetes is **efficient and smooth traffic Ingress management at the application layer**. Getting an application up and running is not the entire story; the app still needs a way for users to access it. The ingress controller Contour was designed to fill this operational gap.

In Kubernetes, **Ingress is a set of routing rules that define how external traffic is routed to an application** inside a Kubernetes cluster. An **Ingress controller** watches for changes to objects in the cluster and then **wires together a data path for each request to be resolved**. An Ingress controller processes the requests for resources, provides transport layer security (TLS) termination, and performs other functions.

Contour acts as a control plane for the Envoy edge and service proxy.
**Envoy** is a Layer 7 (application layer) bus for proxy and communication in modern service-oriented architectures, such as Kubernetes clusters. Envoy strives to make the network transparent to applications while maximizing observability to ease troubleshooting.

![Contour Architecture](../images/contour-architecture.png)

To install Contour, we first have to remove the package from the **excluded_packages**.
```editor:select-matching-text
file: tap-values.yml
text: "  - contour.tanzu.vmware.com"
```
```editor:replace-text-selection
file: tap-values.yml
text: ""
```

By default, Envoy will be exposed over a NodePort service. To change the service type to LoadBalancer, we have to add additional configuration to our tap-values.yml.

As for any other package, we can see the available configuration options via
```execute
tanzu package available list contour.tanzu.vmware.com -n tap-install --kubeconfig kubeconfig.yaml
tanzu package available get contour.tanzu.vmware.com/1.18.2+tap.1 --values-schema -n tap-install --kubeconfig kubeconfig.yaml
```

Let's now add the custom configuration at the end of the file ...
```editor:append-lines-to-file
file: tap-values.yml
text: |
  contour:
    envoy:
      service:
        type: LoadBalancer
```
... and install both components via an update to our profile installation.
```terminal:execute
command: tanzu package installed update tap -p tap.tanzu.vmware.com -v 1.0.2 --values-file tap-values.yml -n tap-install --kubeconfig kubeconfig.yaml 
clear: true
```

Execute the following command and wait until the status of the PackageInstalls is **Reconcile Succeeded**.
```terminal:execute
command: tanzu package installed list -n tap-install --kubeconfig kubeconfig.yaml 
clear: true
````

The next step is to **add a A or CNAME record for e.g. "&ast;.tap.example.com" to your DNS registry** of choice depending on whether the external address of Envoy's LoadBalancer service is an IP or a DNS name.
To get the IP/DNS name of Envoy's LoadBalancer service run the following command:
```terminal:execute
command: kubectl get services -n tanzu-system-ingress
clear: true
```

Now that Contour is installed we can validate it is functioning correctly by deploying an application, exposing it as a service, then creating an Ingress resource. 
```execute
kubectl create namespace my-ingress-app
kubectl -n my-ingress-app create deployment --image=nginx nginx
kubectl -n my-ingress-app expose deployment nginx --port 80
kubectl -n my-ingress-app create ingress nginx --rule="nginx.${TAP_INGRESS_DOMAIN}/*=nginx:80"
```

Validate that your resources are deployed and ready...
```terminal:execute
command: kubectl -n my-ingress-app get all,ingress
clear: true
```

```terminal:execute
command: kubectl -n my-ingress-app get ingress nginx -o yaml
clear: true
```

... and that you can access the application.
```terminal:execute
command: curl -s nginx.$TAP_INGRESS_DOMAIN   | grep h1
clear: true
```

As well as **Ingress** Contour supports a resource type **HTTPProxy** which extends the concept of Ingress to add many features that you would normally have to reach for Istio or a similar service mesh to get.

In TAP most of the components use HTTPProxy, which e.g. has the benefit of being able to reference a TLS Kubernetes Secret in a different namespace. Only *Learning Center for Tanzu Application Service* still uses Ingress resources.

To create a HTTPProxy resource for our deployment, run the following command.
```execute
cat << EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: projectcontour.io/v1
kind: HTTPProxy
metadata:
  name: nginx
  namespace: my-ingress-app
spec:
  virtualhost:
    fqdn: nginx-http-proxy.$TAP_INGRESS_DOMAIN 
  routes:
    - conditions:
      - prefix: /
      services:
        - name: nginx
          port: 80
EOF
```
After we have validated that the resource is ready ...
```terminal:execute
command: kubectl -n my-ingress-app get httpproxy nginx
clear: true
```

... we can access the application via:
```terminal:execute
command: curl -s nginx-http-proxy.$TAP_INGRESS_DOMAIN  | grep h1
clear: true
```

Examples of more advanced features of HttpProxy are rate limiting, weighted routing, and configration of the load balancing strategy for multiple target services.

Letâ€™s clean up our resources before we move on.
```execute
kubectl delete ns my-ingress-app
